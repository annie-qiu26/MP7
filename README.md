Run MemoryGame.java to show the memory board.

Click on a card for it to flip over, revealing an image. Once it's flipped, click on another card to see if the two images match each other. If they do, the next card clicked will have no effect on the previous two cards as they will stay showing. Otherwise, if the two images differ, the next card clicked will hide the two previous cards.

Find all fifty pairs to win. To restart, click anywhere on the board, and all the cards will flip over, so you can start finding pairs again.
